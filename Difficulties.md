## Projected Difficulties

There are several complexities to the project we are proposing. Firstly, we will be creating our own quadrotors to use in this project. The reason for this is that there are simply not enough available to us in order to implement a swarm at this time. Secondly, we will be designing a swarm control system for coordinated movement of our quadrotors. Just in case our self-assembled quadrotors are faulty or incomplete, we will also be implementing our swarm system with models in Gazebo. We may choose to create a model that more closely resembles our self-assembled quadrotors if the default model in Gazebo is not comparable.
