## Purpose

Search and rescue is a dangerous job, requiring a coordinated, large-scale effort to locate survivors of an accident or disaster. Rubble is often unstable, and wilderness areas can be too large to search effectively in a limited amount of time. Our proposed project is to create a swarm control system for aerial (and/or ground-based) robots for search and rescue tasks. We've chosen quadrotors as our target robots due to their ability to traverse a wide area quickly and their maneuverability in order to compensate for obstacles. A large block may be too large for a ground-based robot to maneuver over, but an aerial robot can maneuver in almost any known space.

The big-picture implementation of our project would be for search and rescue assistance. Aerial robots could conduct a coordinated survey of a designated area, giving rescue personnel critical information to safely navigate to found victims. However, with the time that we have to complete our project, coordinated movement will be our core focus.

## Design Documents

- In the [development guidelines](https://ece595project.github.io/quadrotor/Development), you will find information on how we developed our project using [docker](https://ece595project.github.io/quadrotor/Docker).
- On the [docker](https://ece595project.github.io/quadrotor/Docker) page, you will find information on our design methodology to utilize Docker in our swarm.
- In the [quadrotor BOM](https://ece595project.github.io/quadrotor/Quadrotor-BOM), you will find information on how we plan to source the components of our quadrotors for physical testing.
