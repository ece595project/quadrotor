## Software

We will primarily be using ROS and Gazebo for the development of the swarm control system, which means that the vast majority of our code will be written using C, C++, ROS Configuration Scripts, and possibly a small Python component. Development will primarily be done in a virtual machine shared among the group to ensure compatibility with the target system. To accomplish this, we will be using the free software Docker.
