## Software Used

### ROS + Gazebo

Most of the development was done within ROS and Gazebo. Code can be found at the project's GitHub page, and deployment instructions can be found [here](https://ece595project.github.io/quadrotor/Deployment-Instructions).

Code was written in C++ and implemented using `roscpp`. Testing of actual quadcopter readings were done using Python and `rospy`.

### Docker

Docker played a large role in the development and deployment process, and we used Docker extensively for ensuring we had a consistent and clean development environment.
