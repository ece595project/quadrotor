We will primarily be using ROS and Gazebo for the development of the swarm control system, which means that the vast majority of our code will be written using C, C++, ROS Configuration Scripts, and possibly a small Python component. Development will primarily be done in a virtual machine shared among the group to ensure compatibility with the target system. To accomplish this, we will be using the free software Docker.
