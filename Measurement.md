## Milestones

- [x] Initial work completed on quadrotor design.
- [x] Parts ordered from vendors.
- [x] Completed work on ROS movement code.
- [x] Completed work on Docker swarm code.
- [x] Completed ROS integration testing with borrowed quadrotor.
- [x] Partially completed hardware + ROS integration for modules.
    (On hold until parts are received.)
- [ ] Complete quadrotor construction.
- [ ] Complete testing using constructed quadrotors.
- [x] Complete project website.

While we are behind in our milestones by about two weeks, we have completed most of the objectives we had initially set out to accomplish. The last step would have been to test the code we wrote on actual hardware, but due to shipping delays, we just don't have enough time to complete this step.
