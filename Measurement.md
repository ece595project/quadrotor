## Measurement

Deadlines will be established for each phase of our project in order to measure our progress. If any section falls behind deadline, more team development time with be shifted to it. While making design discussions, success criteria will be set for each section of the project. These will be evaluated during final testing to determine how successful we were. During the project, our team will maintain a log of our work, primarily using Github, in order to complete a small report at the end of the semester detailing our progress and conclusions about building a multi-quadrotor swarm system. Our own success metric for this project will be gauged by our findings at the end and the simulation demonstrating proof-of-concept of design.
