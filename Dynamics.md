## Resources

One great thing about quadrotors is that the kinematics of the system are widely known and available, especially at the speeds we hope to operate at. We were able to find resources describing the dynamics we would need to follow using resources widely available on the internet. Here are some resources we used to analyze the dynamics of the system:

- [Quadrotor Dynamics](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/downloads/pdf/Quadcopter%20Dynamics,%20Simulation,%20and%20Control.pdf)
- [Quadrotor Dynamics and Control](http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&context=facpub)
- [Modeling and Linear Control of a Quadrotor](http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/images/6/66/Quadcopter_simulink_paper.pdf)
