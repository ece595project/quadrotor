## Initial Cost Estimate

We estimate that with all components, the quadrotors will cost in the range of ~$60 per quadrotor. We hope to split the cost between the team members to incur an equal cost for the project.

## Actual Cost Estimate

Our cost estimate per quadrotor was quite far from reality. What we failed to take into account was the cost of electronics properly. While micro quadcopters may be possible at the sub $100 range, the necessary components that we required, such as GPS and cameras, increase the size of quadrotor needed to carry the weight, which increases the cost substantially.

Our projected cost for a pre-made quadrotor is on the order of $350.

| Quadrotor | Cost |
| :--- | :---: |
| DJI Phantom | $350 |
| DJI Flame Wheel F450 | $300 |
| Hubsan X4 Pro | $490 |

However, it is still true that we would be able to decrease the cost of the system dramatically if we made the quadrotors ourselves, using parts sourced from a few different sources.
