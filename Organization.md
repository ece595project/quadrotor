## Project Organization

The first phase of our project will be to design our quadrotors. We will discuss what components will be needed and where to source them from. As it may take a while to obtain all components, we will then begin discussing the design of the swarm system and start development while we are waiting on our components to arrive. Once the components arrive, we will be able to develop the code for them individually, so that we can complete our quadrotors once we have all of the components without any delay. Once they are fully assembled, we will begin the final phase and run real-world tests and perform reliability measurements to ensure they are working as desired.

- __Phase 1:__ Design quadrotors and source components.
- __Phase 2:__ Create ROS and Gazebo simulation, and begin development on embedded software.
- __Phase 3:__ Assemble quadrotors and perform real-world testing.

If we are unable to construct our quadrotors before the end of the semester, we may elect to source simpler parts and utilize a different type of robot for simple testing.

We will maintain our code base on Github, which will serve as our code repository as well as the projectâ€™s website (via Github Pages). Because the project is hosted on Github, we will make the project open-source.
