## Project Organization

### Phase 1:

Design quadrotors and purchase components.

The first phase of our project will be to design our quadrotors. We will discuss what components will be needed and where to source them from. As it may take a while to obtain all components, we will then begin discussing the design of the swarm system and start development while we are waiting on our components to arrive.

__NOTE:__ We completed the design of our quadrotors and purchased components necessary to assemble the quadrotors.

### Phase 2:

Create ROS and Gazebo simulation, and begin development on embedded software.

Once the components arrive, we will be able to develop the code for them individually, so that we can complete our quadrotors once we have all of the components without any delay.

__NOTE:__

### Phase 3:

Assemble quadrotors and perform real-world testing.

Once they are fully assembled, we will begin the final phase and run real-world tests and perform reliability measurements to ensure they are working as desired.

If we are unable to construct our quadrotors before the end of the semester, we may elect to source simpler parts and utilize a different type of robot for simple testing.

__NOTE:__ Parts sent back for replacement. Waiting on replacement parts to finish testing.
