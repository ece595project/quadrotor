## Parts

We decided to build a 250mm quadrotor using a frame like the F250 Fiber Glass Frame Kit for QAV250.

This would keep our quadrotors small and portable, which is important for search and rescue workers who are hiking into dangerous or remote terrain.

We also decided to source 2205 motors to fit the frame that could do 2300kV and fit 5" propellers.

This would give us the lift we required while maintaining the small footprint.

We decided on a 4-cell battery with matching power electronics to hook up to the flight controller.

For our quadrotor, we would have liked to have used the Raspberry Pi Zero coupled with the PXF Mini as our flight controller. For testing, we opted to go with a common, cheap flight controller, the Ardupilot Mega.

## Parts List

Parts list is per quadrotor.

| Part | QTY | Cost (Approx.) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| 250mm Quadrotor Frame | 1 | 8 |
| 2205 2300kV Motors | 4 | 10 ea. |
| Ardupilot Mega | 1 | 25 |
| 5 in. Propellers | 4 | 0.50 ea. |
| 4-Cell Battery | 1 | 60 |
| Electronics (set) | 1 | 20 |

Total:
~$155

__NOTE:__ This cost does not factor in the GPS, Raspberry Pi Zero, Camera, or other components necessary to make this work. All together, this would add another ~$100 to the total cost of a single quadrotor.
